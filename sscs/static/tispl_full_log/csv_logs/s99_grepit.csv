4_java_serialization-serialized-data;0;;\\xAC\\xED\\x00\\x05;Java serialized data? Usually Java serialized data in base64 format starts with rO0 or non-base64 with hex ACED0005. Decidezation is something that can result in remote command execution, there are various exploits for such things, see http://foxglovesecurity.com/2015/11/06/what-do-weblogic-websphere-jboss-jenkins-opennms-and-your-application-have-in-common-this-vulnerability/ and https://github.com/mbechler/marshalsec for example;
4_php_proc;68;-i;proc_;Dangerous PHP function: proc_;
5_python_is_object_identity_operator_left;11;;\d\s{1,20}is\s{1,20};The 'is' object identity operator should not be used for numbers, see https://access.redhat.com/blogs/766093/posts/2592591;
5_python_is_object_identity_operator_right;77;;\s{1,20}is\s{1,20}\d;The 'is' object identity operator should not be used for numbers, see https://access.redhat.com/blogs/766093/posts/2592591;
6_php_echo_high_volume;429;-i;echo;Methods that often introduce XSS: echo;
4_python_float_equality_general;525;;\s{1,20}==\s{1,20};The float type can not be reliably compared for equality. Make sure none of these comparisons uses floats, see https://access.redhat.com/blogs/766093/posts/2592591;
6_php_print_high_volume;67;-i;print;Methods that often introduce XSS: print;
7_php_type_unsafe_comparison;669;;[^=]==[^=];The big problem with == is that in PHP (and some other languages), this comparison is not type safe. What you should always use is ===. For example a hash value that starts with 0E could be interpreted as an integer if you don't take care. There were real world bugs exploiting this issue already, think login form and comparing the hashed user password, what happens if you type in 0 as the password and brute force different usernames until a user has a hash which starts with 0E? Then there is also the question of different systems handling/doing Unicode Normalization (see for example https://gosecure.github.io/unicode-pentester-cheatsheet/ and https://www.gosecure.net/blog/2020/08/04/unicode-for-security-professionals/) or not: B\xC3\xBCcher and B\x75\xcc\x88cher is both UTF-8, but one is the character for a real Unicode u-Umlaut while the other is u[COMBINING DIAERESIS]. If the backend normalizes it could be that identifiers clash.;
